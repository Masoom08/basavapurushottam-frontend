          Dr. Dhan Singh Rawat, the cabinet minister of the cooperative department of Uttarakhand, had first dreamed of digitization of multipurpose cooperative societies at the village and Nyaya Panchayat level on the land of Uttarakhand, that dream is being fulfilled today.
          </p>

          <p>
          To do computerization of 670 committees, Dr. Rawat took more than 100 review meetings in about 6 years and had a meaningful talk with all technical experts, including NABARD, visits to M-PACS from time to time, review of digital platforms at village level. It is the result of their hard work, dedication, and clear goals that Uttarakhand has become the first state in the country where villagers are getting the gift of computerization.
          </p>

          <p>
          The number of MPACS committee members of the cooperative department of Uttarakhand state is about 12 lakh. Today, with the computerization of 108 MPACS, the accounts of more than two lakh people have come on the digital platform. As a result of this, more than 5 lakh rural people of the state will be benefitted.
          </p>

          <p>
          108 Multipurpose Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (MPACS) of Uttarakhand State have been brought online today. The work of computerization of the remaining 562 MPACS is going on in full swing. There are a total of 670 MPACS in the state.
          </p>

          <p>
          Farmers are getting the benefit of 108 MPACS being computerized. This endeavor of the government for the provision of agricultural inputs like fertilizers, seeds, etc., after being computerized, has improved the reach of MPACS as a hub of banking activities as well as non-banking activities.
          </p>

          <p>
          108 committees have been made online in the state of Uttarakhand.
          </p>

          <p>
          PACS is a big scheme to strengthen the small and marginal farmers in the agriculture sector in Uttarakhand. PACS, i.e., “Primary Agricultural Credit Cooperative Societies,” are the smallest unit that provides loans to farmers across the country and encourages them financially. These committees are being made online to ensure transparency. About 108 committees have been made online so far, making Uttarakhand one of the foremost states in the country. Since 2019, work has been ongoing to computerize all the multipurpose primary agricultural credit societies of the state.
          </p>

          <p>
          The arrangements for making the accounts of the committees online can now be done easily. MPACS computerization will secure the capital of members and villagers deposited in these societies and also make deposits and withdrawals easier. With MPACS computerization, farmers or account holders can view their deposits from anywhere and use them across the country through Rupay Debit Cards. With the computerization of MPACS, societies will be able to easily carry out deposits, marketing, consumer services, joint cooperative agricultural transactions, DBT, and other activities.
          </p>

          <p>
          Minister Dr. Rawat said that one of the main objectives of the government is to increase the efficiency of 670 Multipurpose Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (MPACS) in the state, bring transparency and accountability in their operations, and facilitate PACS to diversify their business and start various activities and services.
          </p>

          <p>
          In view of the need to computerize MPACS to digitally empower the multipurpose primary agricultural credit cooperative societies of the state, in collaboration with the State Government Cooperative Bank and NABARD, a project costing Rs. 37.52 crore was conceptualized. This initiative aims to bring these primary cooperative institutions onto the digital platform and ensure participation in the “Digital India” flagship program of the Government of India. The work of computerization of 670 MPACS started in 2019. Computerization of 108 MPACS has been completed online, while the remaining 562 MPACS have achieved 60 to 90 percent completion.
          </p>

          <p>
          As a result of bringing the multipurpose primary agricultural credit cooperative societies of the state onto the digital platform, besides boosting the cooperative movement, farmers, members of societies, and the people of the state are expected to benefit in multiple ways.
          </p>

          <p>
          In MPACS, the data of members will be transparently preserved. With the computerization of MPACS, the Nyaya Panchayat–level infrastructure of 670 committees will be strengthened, and necessary information can be exchanged in a timely manner. The complete data of multipurpose primary agricultural credit cooperative societies can be managed through the CBS system at the state level.
          </p>

          <p>
          The benefits of MPACS are as follows:
          </p>

          <p>
          MPACS means multipurpose primary agricultural credit societies of which farmers are members.
          </p>

          <p>
          This is the smallest loan-providing unit in the cooperative system, operating at the village level.
          </p>

          <p>
          These societies are formed to save farmers from the clutches of moneylenders.
          </p>

          <p>
          Farmers receive loans at low interest rates through MPACS committees.
          </p>

          <p>
          Availability of fertilizers, seeds, and even medicines is ensured through these committees.
          </p>

          <p>
          Crop loans are easily accessible through MPACS.
          </p>

          <p>
          Interest benefits are also provided on timely repayment of loans.
          </p>

          <p>
          Loans of up to Rs. 20 lakhs are available for purchasing agricultural plants and equipment.
          </p>

            Pushpa Harela Festival was celebrated at Shyampur by Laldhang MPACS
            under the CCF model. </p>
            
          <p>   
            Also, a Collection Centre for flowers and other
            agro-produce was inaugurated.
          </p>

          <p>
            Active participation of women was seen in CCF activities like
            turmeric, mint, and marigold cultivation through MPACS.
          </p>
          <p>
            UKCDP-Uttarakhand State Integrated Cooperative Development Project 
            is envisaged with the far-reaching objective of making multipurpose 
            cooperative societies strong and self-sufficient business units in 
            the agriculture sector. This scheme is under the Central Sector 
            Integrated Agricultural Cooperation Project (CSISAC) of the Government of India.
          </p>

          <p>
          Under Component-1, it is being operated in the state of Uttarakhand. 
          The Department of Cooperation is the nodal department of the project. 
          National Cooperative Development Corporation, 
          Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India has sanctioned loan/grant 
          amounting to Rs.3,340 crore for project operation. The financial nature 
          of the project is in the form of loan, grant and M.PAX contribution in the ratio 
          of 70:20:10 respectively to the total amount. The objective of the project is to
           increase the income of farmers through cooperative societies.
          </p>

          <p> 
          Under the Collective Cooperative Farming (CCF) value chain in the
           project by UKCDP, the group cultivation of aromatic plants in
            Gandikhata cluster was started with the cultivation of lemongrass
             in June 2020 by Laldhang Cooperative Society of Haridwar district. 
             Excited by the results of lemongrass
          </p>

          <p>
            Farmers in the Laldhang cluster also started cultivating mint and marigold
            flowers to increase their income. To support this initiative, the Cooperative
            Department developed a value chain for treaty plants under joint cooperative
            farming in the Laldhang cluster. Through this, multiple profit opportunities
            were made available to farmers.
          </p>

          <p>
            After MPACS Laldhang assured the purchase of marigold flowers, farmers began
            cultivating marigold as a short-duration cash crop. Technical assistance was
            provided to MPACS members in coordination with CAP, the Horticulture Department,
            AATMA, and Krishi Vigyan Kendra.
            Convergence support from line departments and CAPs enabled access to planting
            material, fertilizers, and agricultural machinery. Processing and marketing
            facilities were provided through MPACS, increasing the chances of higher
            profitability for farmers. An interest-free loan scheme was linked with Pandit
            Deen Dayal Upadhyay’s Cooperative Farmer Welfare initiative.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Achievements of MPACS:</strong> Despite challenges in the Laldhang
            region, MPACS planned mass cultivation of marigold flowers starting in March
            2022. The selected varieties included Calcutta Variety African Marigold and
            Jaffrey Marigold.
            In April 2022, with technical assistance from the Horticulture Department,
            approximately 2 lakh marigold plants were provided. Floriculture activities
            began across 20 acres under MPACS, and the first crop was harvested on July 16
            during the Pushpa Harela festival.
            In July 2022, production of nearly one and a half quintals of marigold flowers
            was estimated from 2.5 acres of land. Additional sowing was planned in July,
            with future expansion targeted up to 100 acres.
            Marigold flowers will be marketed at Kankhal and Jwalapur markets in Haridwar.
            The estimated annual investment per acre for the Calcutta variety is
            Rs. 46,150. Expected annual production per bigha is 1,500 kg, generating an
            income of approximately Rs. 90,000.
            The estimated annual net profit per bigha from marigold cultivation is
            Rs. 43,850.

            The departments have been monitoring the implementation of Fisheries and Sheep & Goat activities through physical verification, reports and MPRs. The need of the hour is to use real time monitoring systems such as software / apps / MIS etc. Currently the departments are in process of preparing strategy and implementable plan for MIS and app based systems to monitor field level activities. In this context team members of USGCF gave the presentation on mobile based app which can be used at farmers’ level. Direct data entry can be done at farmers level covering various components such as animal’s birth, procurement of animal, fodder/feed, vaccination, health, sale etc. It was advised to the department that synchronization of app needs to be ensured with the MIS developed by the department. The department was further instructed to check the feasibility of using app at farmers’ level. Systems need to be created for effective utilization of app based systems. The existing FIUs, Farmer Service Centres can be connected to make it implementable at field level. The department is also advised to explore more options where this app can be utilized effectively. Fisheries team was also instructed to explore the opportunities for using this app. The sector will also focus on developing Angling Tourism along with homestay development. For this the team is instructed to identify the picturesque locations. The team was also advised to take the benefit of Amrit Sarovar Scheme and find the opportunity on how this scheme can be connected to fishery activity.

            The four sectors of UKCDP project namely Cooperative, Sheep & Goat, Dairy and Fishery sectors have been playing a vital role in planning, strategizing and implementing the key activities through farmer groups/cooperatives. The concerned teams presented the weekly progress of the works undertaken. Meeting was held with Sheep & Goat sector, Dairy and Cooperative sector on 22nd June 2022 to review their weekly progress. It was discussed that Goat Valley Project can be collaborated with Homestay project. Development of about 10 Goat valleys will be targeted this year. The team will identify the picturesque locations in the goat valleys to develop the homestays. Such initiatives will promote employment among local population alongside generating income to farmers from goat rearing. Sheep & Goat sector in convergence with Dairy department have been able to procure goat milk from farmers in chilled cans. Market exercise has been undertaken by the team. Few samples of packaged Goat Milk (200 ml) shall be distributed among the retailers for pilot testing and to gather customers’ feedback. Few samples of goat milk were also presented by the team during meeting. The department was also instructed to explore projects with Govt. sheep farms in the state on PPP mode based on the requirements. The departments were also instructed to promote digital payments wherever any sale is happening such as Uttarafish outlets, BAKRAW outlets etc. About 1-2 homestays per district will be also identified under dairy sector where milk activities are being undertaken. It was also discussed that the team should put an effort to maintain animals’ health through software or app based systems. Cooperative department presented the draft financial model for homestay development. It was suggested that few homestay owners in nearby districts can be contacted to validate the assumptions taken for the input costs, taxes etc.

            Pushpa Harela Festival was celebrated at Shyampur by Laldhang MPACS
            under the CCF model. </p>
            
          <p>   
            Also, a Collection Centre for flowers and other
            agro-produce was inaugurated.
          </p>

          <p>
            Active participation of women was seen in CCF activities like
            turmeric, mint, and marigold cultivation through MPACS.
          </p>
          <p>
            UKCDP-Uttarakhand State Integrated Cooperative Development Project 
            is envisaged with the far-reaching objective of making multipurpose 
            cooperative societies strong and self-sufficient business units in 
            the agriculture sector. This scheme is under the Central Sector 
            Integrated Agricultural Cooperation Project (CSISAC) of the Government of India.
          </p>

          <p>
          Under Component-1, it is being operated in the state of Uttarakhand. 
          The Department of Cooperation is the nodal department of the project. 
          National Cooperative Development Corporation, 
          Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India has sanctioned loan/grant 
          amounting to Rs.3,340 crore for project operation. The financial nature 
          of the project is in the form of loan, grant and M.PAX contribution in the ratio 
          of 70:20:10 respectively to the total amount. The objective of the project is to
           increase the income of farmers through cooperative societies.
          </p>

          <p> 
          Under the Collective Cooperative Farming (CCF) value chain in the
           project by UKCDP, the group cultivation of aromatic plants in
            Gandikhata cluster was started with the cultivation of lemongrass
             in June 2020 by Laldhang Cooperative Society of Haridwar district. 
             Excited by the results of lemongrass
          </p>

          <p>
            Farmers in the Laldhang cluster also started cultivating mint and marigold
            flowers to increase their income. To support this initiative, the Cooperative
            Department developed a value chain for treaty plants under joint cooperative
            farming in the Laldhang cluster. Through this, multiple profit opportunities
            were made available to farmers.
          </p>

          <p>
            After MPACS Laldhang assured the purchase of marigold flowers, farmers began
            cultivating marigold as a short-duration cash crop. Technical assistance was
            provided to MPACS members in coordination with CAP, the Horticulture Department,
            AATMA, and Krishi Vigyan Kendra.
            Convergence support from line departments and CAPs enabled access to planting
            material, fertilizers, and agricultural machinery. Processing and marketing
            facilities were provided through MPACS, increasing the chances of higher
            profitability for farmers. An interest-free loan scheme was linked with Pandit
            Deen Dayal Upadhyay’s Cooperative Farmer Welfare initiative.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Achievements of MPACS:</strong> Despite challenges in the Laldhang
            region, MPACS planned mass cultivation of marigold flowers starting in March
            2022. The selected varieties included Calcutta Variety African Marigold and
            Jaffrey Marigold.
            In April 2022, with technical assistance from the Horticulture Department,
            approximately 2 lakh marigold plants were provided. Floriculture activities
            began across 20 acres under MPACS, and the first crop was harvested on July 16
            during the Pushpa Harela festival.
            In July 2022, production of nearly one and a half quintals of marigold flowers
            was estimated from 2.5 acres of land. Additional sowing was planned in July,
            with future expansion targeted up to 100 acres.
            Marigold flowers will be marketed at Kankhal and Jwalapur markets in Haridwar.
            The estimated annual investment per acre for the Calcutta variety is
            Rs. 46,150. Expected annual production per bigha is 1,500 kg, generating an
            income of approximately Rs. 90,000.
            The estimated annual net profit per bigha from marigold cultivation is
            Rs. 43,850.
